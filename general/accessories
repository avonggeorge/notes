A  **bundler**  is a tool used in software development, particularly in web development, to compile and package multiple resources (like JavaScript, CSS, and images) into a smaller set of files that can be more efficiently served to users. This process helps improve loading times and overall performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests needed for a web page.

Some common functionalities and features of bundlers include:

1.  **Module Bundling**: Combining various modules or files into a single output file or a few files to streamline loading.
    
2.  **Code Splitting**: Breaking the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, rather than loading everything at once.
    
3.  **Transformation**: Converting modern JavaScript (like ES6+) or TypeScript code into a format that can run in older browsers using tools like Babel.
    
4.  **Asset Management**: Handling non-code assets (such as images and fonts) and optimizing them for size and performance.
    
5.  **Development Server**: Providing a local server for development purposes, allowing for features like hot module replacement (HMR) for a smoother development experience.
    

Popular bundlers include  **Webpack**,  **Parcel**, and  **Rollup**. Each has its own strengths and specific use cases, making it important to choose one that aligns with your projectâ€™s needs.
