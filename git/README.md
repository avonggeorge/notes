if we are working on a repo with two branches, When i push to the updates does it go to branch A if that was the place i was working or how does it work

When working with a Git repository that has multiple branches, your pushed updates will only go to the branch you have checked out when you perform the push operation. Here’s how it works:

Current Branch: Before you push changes, make sure you're on the branch where you've made your updates. You can check this by running git branch in your terminal, which will show you which branch is currently checked out (marked with an asterisk).

Pushing Changes: If you are on Branch A and you run git push, Git will push your updates to Branch A on the remote repository (typically the one linked to your local repository).

Switching Branches: If you want to push changes to a different branch (say Branch B), you'll need to check out that branch first using git checkout BranchB, make your changes, and then push.

Default Behavior: If you're tracking remote branches (which is common), your push command will typically be directed to the corresponding remote branch. For example, if Branch A has an upstream branch set up, executing git push will push your changes to the corresponding remote branch of Branch A.

In summary, always ensure you're on the correct branch before pushing to make sure your changes go where you intend. If you need more details on any of the commands or concepts, feel free to ask!

so when I pull do I get changes from all the branches?

No, when you run the git pull command, you only retrieve changes from the specific branch you are currently checked out to. Here's a bit more detail on how it works:

Current Branch: git pull updates your current branch with data from its corresponding upstream branch on the remote repository. For example, if you are on Branch A and run git pull, Git will fetch the changes from the remote version of Branch A only.

Fetching Changes: The git pull command is essentially a combination of git fetch (which retrieves updates from the remote repository) followed by git merge (which integrates those changes into your local branch). This process is limited to the branch you currently have checked out.

Other Branches: If you want to get updates from other branches, you must switch to each branch and perform git pull individually. For example:

Switch to Branch B: git checkout BranchB
Then pull the changes: git pull
Fetching All Changes: If you're interested in updates from all branches without merging them into your current branch, you can use:

bash
git fetch  
This command will retrieve changes from all branches but will not apply them to your local branches. You would then have to switch to those branches and merge manually to update them.

In summary, git pull only affects the branch you are on, so if you want changes from other branches, you need to check them out and pull individually. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification!

if i fetch update, can i test the update if i dont merge

Yes, you can test updates from a fetch without merging them into your current branch. Here’s how you can do that:

Steps to Test Fetch Updates Without Merging
Fetch Updates: Run the following command to fetch updates from the remote repository. This will download changes without merging them into your current branch:

bash
git fetch  
Check Remote Branches: After fetching, you can inspect the updates on the remote branches. Suppose you want to see what changes have been made on origin/BranchB (assuming origin is your remote name):

bash
git log origin/BranchB  
This will show you the commit history of the remote branch without affecting your current branch.

Create a New Local Branch for Testing:
If you want to test the updates in a safe environment, you can create a new local branch based on the remote branch:

bash
git checkout -b test-branch origin/BranchB  
This creates a new branch called test-branch that starts from the latest commit of the remote BranchB. You can now test the code without affecting your work on other branches.

Run Tests: In your new branch, you can test any updates or changes as needed. Since this branch is independent, it won’t affect your current working branch.

Return to Original Branch: After testing, if you want to go back to your original working branch, use:

bash
git checkout your-original-branch  
Clean Up: If you no longer need the test branch, you can delete it with:

bash
git branch -d test-branch  
Summary
By using git fetch followed by a temporary branch, you can safely test updates without merging them into your main development branch. This approach allows you to review and validate new changes before deciding to integrate them
