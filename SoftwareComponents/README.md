# **"software components"** or **"software artifacts."**

### Explanation:

-   **Software Components**: This term encompasses all reusable pieces of code that can be integrated into applications. It highlights the modular nature of software development, where different parts can be developed, maintained, and reused independently.
    
-   **Software Artifacts**: This broader term refers to any byproduct produced during the software development process, including source code files, documentation, libraries, frameworks, and more.
    

These terms help categorize various elements that contribute to software development and architecture.


| Feature            | Module                                       | Library                                       | Framework                                    | Package                                       | SDK (Software Development Kit)                | API (Application Programming Interface)      |

| **Definition**      | A single file or collection of related code. | A collection of pre-written code for specific tasks. | A comprehensive platform for building applications. | A collection of modules packaged together.    | A set of tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples for building applications. | A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. |
| **Purpose**         | Organizes code and promotes reusability.     | Provides reusable functions and tools for developers. | Offers a structured way to develop applications, enforcing design patterns. | Organizes related modules for distribution and reuse. | Provides developers with everything needed to develop software for a specific platform. | Allows different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. |
| **Control Flow**    | Developer has full control over the flow of execution. | Developer calls the library functions as needed. | Framework controls the flow; developers fill in specific parts. | Similar to modules; the developer controls how to use them. | The developer uses the tools and libraries as needed, but the SDK may dictate certain structures. | The API defines how software components should interact, often with specific methods and endpoints. |
| **Complexity**      | Generally simple and focused on specific tasks. | Can be complex, with many functions, but usually less than a framework. | Often complex, providing extensive features and functionalities. | Generally simple, focused on related modules. | Can be complex, often including multiple libraries and tools. | Varies widely; can be simple or complex depending on the functionality exposed. |
| **Usage**           | Used for specific functionalities (e.g., math operations). | Used to add specific capabilities (e.g., data manipulation, networking). | Used to build entire applications (e.g., web, mobile). | Used to distribute and manage related modules. | Used to create applications for specific platforms (e.g., iOS, Android). | Used to enable communication between different software systems (e.g., web services). |
| **Examples**        | Python's `math`, `os` modules.              | NumPy, Pandas (Python libraries).            | Django, Ruby on Rails, Angular (web frameworks). | Python's `requests` package (which includes multiple modules). | Android SDK, iOS SDK.                        | RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs.                 |
